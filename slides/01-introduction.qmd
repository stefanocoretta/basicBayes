## Inference process

![The inference process.](../img/inference.png)

::: notes
We take a **sample** from the population.

This is our empirical data (the product of observation).

How do we go from data/observation to answering our question?

We can use **inference**.

**Inference** is the process of understanding something about a population based on the sample (aka the data) taken from that population.
:::

## Fallibility

::: box-note
-   However, inference based on data does not guarantee infallible answers.

-   In fact, any observation we make comes with a degree of **uncertainty and variability**.
:::

. . .

::: box-tip
-   Any one observation is uncertain.

-   There aren't any two observations that are identical.

## *Statistics* as a tool

::: box-note
Statistics helps us to **quantify uncertainty** and **account for variability**.

## Statistical model

::: box-note
A **statistical model** is a mathematical model that represents the relationship between variables in the data.

## The MALD data set

::: box-note
**Massive Auditory Lexical Decision** data set @tucker2019.

-   MALD data set:

    -   Lexical decision task in English.

    -   Stimuli presented aurally.

    -   521 subjects.

-   Subset of MALD

    -   30 subjects, 100 observations each.
:::

## MALD: the data

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
#| label: mald

mald <- readRDS("data/tucker2019/mald_1_1.rds")

mald
```

## Mean RT (with standard deviation)

```{r}
#| label: mald-mean

mald |> 
  summarise(
    mean_rt = round(mean(RT)),
    sd_rt = round(sd(RT))
  )
```

Are you happy with the answer?
:::

## Problem: uncertainty and variability

::: box-note
-   These are the *sample* mean and standard deviation (SD).

-   But what about the *population* mean and SD?
:::

. . .

::: box-tip
-   In the face of uncertainty and variability, we can use probability distributions.

-   A family of probability distributions that can be identified (i.e. summarised) by a mean and SD is the Gaussian (aka "normal") distribution family (Gaussian distribution for short).
