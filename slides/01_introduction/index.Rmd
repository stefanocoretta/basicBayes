## Inference process

.center[
![:scale 75%](../../img/inference.png)
]

???

We take a **sample** from the population.

This is our empirical data (the product of observation).

How do we go from data/observation to answering our question?

We can use **inference**.

**Inference** is the process of understanding something about a population based on the sample (aka the data) taken from that population.

class: middle center inverse

## Inference is not infallible

???

However, inference based on data does not guarantee that the answers to our questions are right/true.

In fact, any observation we make comes with a degree of **uncertainty and variability**.

## Uncertainty and variability

.center[

???

So we have to deal with:

- Uncertainty in any observation of a phenomenon.

- Variability among different observations of the same phenomenon.

class: center, middle, inverse

???

Guess what it is...

class: center middle inverse

## *Statistics* as a tool to deal with *uncertainty* and *variability*

???

Statistics helps us quantifying uncertainty and accounting for variability.
