title: "Learn Bayesian Linear Models for Beginners"
---

This is the website of the workshop **basicBayes**.

Please, check the [Set-up](setup.qmd) page for important set-up instructions, before joining the workshop.

This workshop assumes you have a **good command of R and tidyverse packages**, but no prior experience with linear modelling is required.

If you wish to revise your basic R skills, we recommend the following resource: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (online book).
