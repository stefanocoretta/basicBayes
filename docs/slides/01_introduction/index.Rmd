## Inference process

.center[
![:scale 75%](../../img/inference.png)
]

???

We take a **sample** from the population.

This is our empirical data (the product of observation).

How do we go from data/observation to answering our question?

We can use **inference**.

**Inference** is the process of understanding something about a population based on the sample (aka the data) taken from that population.

class: middle center inverse

## Inference is not infallible

???

However, inference based on data does not guarantee that the answers to our questions are right/true.

In fact, any observation we make comes with a degree of **uncertainty and variability**.

## Uncertainty and variability

.center[
![](../../img/pliny.jpg)
]

???

So we have to deal with:

- Uncertainty in any observation of a phenomenon.

- Variability among different observations of the same phenomenon.

Guess what it is...

class: center middle inverse

## *Statistics* as a tool to deal with *uncertainty* and *variability*

???

Statistics helps us quantifying uncertainty and accounting for variability.

## The MALD dataset

---

[Massive Auditory Lexical Decision](https://aphl.artsrn.ualberta.ca/?page_id=827) (Tucker et al. 2019):

- **MALD data set**: 521 subjects, RTs and accuracy.

- Subset of MALD: 30 subjects, 100 observations each.

- Let's investigate the effect of *mean phone-level Levenshtein distance* and *lexical status* (word vs non-word).

**Probability**

- Probability of an **event occurring** or of a **variable taking on a specific value**.

- Probabilities can only be **between 0 and 1**.

  - ‚õîÔ∏è 0 means **impossible**.

## Probability distributions

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
A **probability distribution** is a mathematical function that describes *how the probabilities are distributed over the values* that a variable can take on.
]

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
Two types of probability distributions

- **Discrete probability distributions.**

- **Continuous probability distributions.**
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
Discrete variables follow discrete probability distributions and continuous variables follow continuous probability distributions.
]

---

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
We can **visualise probability distributions**:

- Using the **probability mass function** for discrete probability distributions.

- Using the **probability density function** for continuous probability distributions.

**Probability Density Function**

```{r rt-dens, echo=FALSE}
rt_dens <- mald %>%
  ggplot(aes(RT)) +
  geom_density(fill = "#9970ab", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_rug(alpha = 0.05) +

  labs(
    title = "Expected probability density of RT",
    x = "RT", y = "Probability density (relative probability)"
  )

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Probability distributions can be expressed using parameters.**

- We can summarise a probability distribution by specifying the **parameters' values**.

- Different types of probability distributions have a different number of parameters and different parameters.
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
The **Gaussian probability distribution** is a continuous probability distribution and it has two parameters:

- The mean $\mu$.
- The standard deviation $\sigma$.
